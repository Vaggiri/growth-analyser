# Growth Tracker - Startup Analytics Dashboard

A self-contained, responsive, front-end dashboard for tracking a startup's key growth metrics. This tool provides a clean interface for visualizing project earnings, client distribution, and overall revenue growth over time, all from a single HTML file.

*(Note: You should replace this with a screenshot of your own project)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  - **Frontend:** HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

  - **Charts:** [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
  - **Animations:** [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to be extremely simple to set up and run, as it has no backend dependencies.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/growth-tracker.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd growth-tracker
    ```

3.  **Open the file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    > **Pro Tip:** For the best experience, you can use a simple live server. If you have VS Code, the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension is a great choice.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application is built within a single `index.html` file.

  - **Data Initialization:** On page load, the `loadSampleData()` JavaScript function generates a set of 20 random projects to populate the dashboard.
  - **State Management:** All project data is stored in a JavaScript array (`let projects = []`). Any additions, edits, or deletions manipulate this array directly. **Note: Data will reset upon page refresh.**
  - **UI Rendering:** The UI is dynamically updated whenever the data changes. Functions like `updateDashboardMetrics()`, `updateProjectsTable()`, and `updateCharts()` are called to re-render the components with the latest data.
  - **Backend Placeholder:** The function `saveToGoogleSheets(action, id, data)` is a placeholder. In a real-world application, you would replace its `console.log` with an API call (e.g., using `gapi` for Google Sheets) to persist the data.

## üéØ Future Improvements

This project serves as a great template. Here are some potential features to add:

  - [ ] **Google Sheets Integration:** Implement the `saveToGoogleSheets` function to create a truly persistent data source.
  - [ ] **User Authentication:** Add a login system to protect the data.
  - [ ] **Data Export:** Add a feature to export project data as a CSV file.
  - [ ] **Functional Filters:** Wire up the search and filter UI on the "Projects" page.
  - [ ] **Settings Page:** Build out the "Settings" page to allow users to customize their experience (e.g., set currency, targets).
